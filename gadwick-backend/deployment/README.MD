# Deployment

Run "npm run-script deploy"

## Configs

Configuration files are not stored in the repo, only as a local copy, to avoid account details being compromised if the repo is public.

These allow us to easily deploy to test or production environments without needing to swap out test keys or endpoints for live ones.
